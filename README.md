# 1. Cloud Infrastructure & Deployment (Azure)

Task Overview:

Set up a simple web application using Node.js and deploy it on Azure App Service or an Azure Virtual Machine. The application should be publicly accessible via a URL.

Solution Overview:

The web application was deployed on Azure using Azure App Service. The application is configured to run Node.js, and it is accessible via a public URL.

Steps to Deploy the Application:
	1.	Create an Azure Account and Log in:
		Ensure you have an active Azure subscription.
  
	2.	Create a Resource Group:
	•	In Azure Portal, navigate to Resource Groups.
	•	Click Add and provide a name for the resource group (cicd-pipeline_group).
	•	Select a region Central India (zone 1), then click Review + Create.
 
	3. Create an Azure Virtual Machine:
	•	In Azure Portal, navigate to Virtual Machines and click Add.
	•	Select the Resource Group and configure the VM settings (image, size, authentication).
	•	Create and ensuring proper network security rules (e.g., open port 80, 8080,9000,3000,5173 etc).
 
	4. Set Up Docker on the Azure VM

	5. Install Jenkins on the VM:
 
	1.	Install Jenkins on the VM:
	•	Follow installation steps for your VM’s OS (Ubuntu example: sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk && sudo apt install jenkins).
	2.	Start Jenkins:
	•	Access Jenkins via http://98.70.55.30:8080.
	6. Integrate Jenkins with GitHub:
	•	GitHub Webhook: In your GitHub repository, add a webhook pointing to Jenkins.
	•	Jenkins Configuration: Set up a Pipeline Job in Jenkins with GitHub repository details and configure the pipeline using a Jenkinsfile for CI/CD.
	7. Deploy the Application with Jenkins:
	•	Set up the Jenkins pipeline to build, test, and deploy my Todo-app.
	•	On push to GitHub, the webhook triggers Jenkins to pull the code, Do docker compose up, and deploy it to the Azure VM.
	8. Access the Application:
	•	After successful deployment, access your app through the public IP of the Azure VM.

2. CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

Task Overview:

Create a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment of the Todo-app web application using Jenkins.

Solution Overview:

I implemented a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline that automates the deployment of the web application to Azure App Service. This pipeline includes stages for building, testing, and deploying the application.

Explanation of Different Pipeline Stages:

 1.	Build Stage:

 •	Checkout Repository: The pipeline begins by checking out the latest code from the GitHub repository.

 •	Set Up Docker: The Docker environment is set up for building the application image.

 •	Build Docker Image: Using Docker Compose, the pipeline builds a Docker image of the application.

 •	Install Dependencies: Inside the Docker container, dependencies are installed using npm install.

 •	Run Tests: The tests are executed using npm test to ensure that the application is stable and working as expected.

 2.	Quality Analysis Stage (SonarQube Integration):

 •	Scan with SonarQube: The code is scanned using SonarQube for quality checks, including static code analysis and detection of bugs or vulnerabilities.

 3. 	Deploy Stage (Using Jenkins, Docker Compose, and Azure VM):

 •	Run Docker Container: In this stage, Jenkins triggers the execution of the Docker Compose file to bring up the application containers on the Azure VM using the command: docker-compose down to stop any existing containers and docker-compose up -d to start new ones.

 •	Deploy to Azure VM: The final deployment step deploys the application to the Azure Virtual Machine using Docker Compose, ensuring the app runs in a consistent environment across deployments.
 
How Environment Variables/Secrets are Managed:

Jenkins Credentials Store: Jenkins provides a Credentials Manager that securely stores sensitive data like usernames, passwords, tokens, and publish profiles.
These credentials were added under Jenkins → Manage Jenkins → Manage Credentials.
The credentials are stored in a secure manner and are used in the pipeline to interact with Azure, GitHub, and SonarQube.

<h2>3. Security & Compliance (ISO, GDPR, SOC 2)</h2>

Security Risks in DevOps & Mitigation

1. Insecure Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
 Risk: Flawed IaC can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and system downtime.
 Mitigation:

• Code Reviews & Automated Scanning

• Version Control & Least Privilege Access

• Compliance: ISO 27001 (A.12.5), GDPR (Art. 32), SOC 2

2. Leaky Secrets Management
 Risk: Exposed API keys & credentials lead to unauthorized access.

 Mitigation:
• Secrets Management Tools & Environment Variables

• Avoid Hardcoding & Rotate Secrets Regularly

• Compliance: ISO 27001 (A.12.1), GDPR (Art. 32), SOC 2

3. Vulnerable Dependencies
 Risk: Outdated libraries introduce security threats.
 Mitigation:

• Dependency Scanning & Regular Updates

• Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

• Compliance: ISO 27001 (A.14.2), GDPR (Art. 32)

<h1>5. Database & Storage Optimization (PostgreSQL)</h1>

1. Indexing for Faster Queries

 Issue: Full table scans slow down queries.
  Solution:
• Use B-Tree Index for lookups

• Before: SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com'; (Slow)

• After: CREATE INDEX idx_email ON users (email); (Fast lookup)

2. Query Optimization

  Issue: Slow queries due to poor joins & unnecessary data fetching.
  Solution:

• Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE for performance insights

• Avoid SELECT *, index foreign keys

• Before: Unindexed JOIN (Slow)

• After: Indexed JOIN (Faster retrieval)

3. Data Partitioning for Large Tables

  Issue: Full-table scans slow down queries on large datasets.
  Solution:
• Use Partitioning:

• Range Partitioning (e.g., orders by year)

• List Partitioning (e.g., users by country)

• Hash Partitioning (even data distribution)

Example:
 CREATE TABLE orders PARTITION BY RANGE (order_date);
 
 CREATE TABLE orders_2024 PARTITION OF orders 
 
 FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-12-31');

 <h1>6. Automation & Scripting</h1>
 Bash Script for Log Analysis

🔹 Tasks:
✅ Scan logs for errors/failures
✅ Count & display last 10 errors

 	#!/bin/bash
 	LOG_FILE="/var/log/syslog"
	ERROR_PATTERN="error|failed|critical"
	echo "Analyzing log file: $LOG_FILE"
	grep -iE "$ERROR_PATTERN" "$LOG_FILE" | tail -10

 Run: bash log_analysis.sh (Extracts critical errors.)

<h1>7. Disaster Recovery & High Availability</h1>

1. Disaster Recovery (DR) Strategy

Objectives: Minimize downtime & data loss, ensure compliance.
 RTO & RPO:
  
 • Mission-Critical Apps: RTO ≤ 5 min, RPO ≤ 1 min (Real-time replication)
  
 • Non-Critical Systems: RTO ≤ 12 hrs, RPO ≤ 24 hrs (Daily backups)

2. Backup & DR Strategies (Azure Cloud)

 • Azure VM Backup: Snapshots & full backup (Retention: 7-30 days)
  
 • SQL DB Backup: Point-in-Time Restore (PITR) (Retention: 35 days)
  
 • Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS): Ensures immediate recovery

3. Automated Backup Setup in Azure

 For Azure VM:
• Go to Backup Center → Create Vault → Enable Backup
• Set Backup Policy (Daily 2 AM, Retention: 30 days)

 <h3>High Availability (HA) Best Practices</h3>

• Deploy Across Availability Zones (Multiple data centers)
• Use Load Balancers (Traffic distribution & auto-failover)
• Implement Auto-Scaling (Adjust resources as needed)
• Enable Active Geo-Replication (Multi-region data copies)

Document: Security Risks in DevOps and Mitigation Strategies
DevOps focuses on enhancing speed and efficiency in software development and deployment. However, this rapid pace can sometimes lead to security vulnerabilities. We will examine three significant risks and the strategies to mitigate them.

Risk 1: Insecure Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

What it is: IaC involves using code to manage and provision infrastructure (servers, networks, etc.). If this code has flaws or vulnerabilities, it can result in extensive security weaknesses throughout your environment. Think of it as a blueprint for your house â€“ if the blueprint is flawed, the house will be too.
  Impact: Unauthorized access, data breaches, system downtime.
  Mitigation Strategies:
    Code Reviews: Similar to regular code, IaC should be evaluated by security experts to spot potential issues before deployment.
      Automated Security Scanning: Implement tools to automatically scan IaC for vulnerabilities. This is akin to having a building inspector assess the house during construction.
      Version Control: Monitor changes to your IaC. This allows you to revert to a secure version if something goes awry. It's like maintaining a record of all modifications made to the house blueprint.
      Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure that the accounts used to deploy IaC possess only the necessary permissions. Avoid granting access to everything when you only need to open one door.
      Compliance Alignment: These practices directly support ISO 27001 (A.12.5 - Information System Acquisition, Development and Maintenance), GDPR (Article 32 - Security of processing), and SOC 2 (Common Criteria - Security).

Risk 2: Leaky Secrets Management
What it is: Applications frequently require secrets such as passwords, API keys, and database credentials. Storing these directly in...
